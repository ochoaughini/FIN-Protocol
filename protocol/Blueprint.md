## FIN™ Protocol — Cognitive System Blueprint

**Version 1.0 • Authored by Augusto Ochoa Ughini, MD**

### Abstract

The Blueprint defines the internal architecture of the FIN Protocol as a cognitive engine. It outlines the relationships between symbolic structures, narrative units, decision layers, semantic anchors, and observational feedback loops.

This document is a reference map — it precedes code. Its purpose is to clarify intent, traceability, and system design.

### Layered Design

The FIN architecture is composed of interdependent layers:

1. **Signal Layer**  
   - Input from cases, images, events, clinical prompts  
   - Example: “Patient with jaundice” or “AST/ALT ratio”

2. **Interpretation Layer**  
   - Pattern recognition, semantic anchoring, classification  
   - Example: Mapping symptoms to `ICD-10 K74.6`

3. **Narrative Layer**  
   - Simulation of reasoning using structured `ClinicalTurn` objects  
   - Each turn includes echo tracking, semantic anchors, and intent

4. **Feedback Layer**  
   - ECO Tracking, doubt propagation, trust decay  
   - Example: Recognizing delay in diagnosis due to initial false negative

5. **Abstraction Layer**  
   - Meta-reasoning, model inspection, retrospective analysis  
   - Used in validation, benchmarking, or simulation audits

### Roles and Objects

| Role              | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `CaseSimulation`  | Orchestrates the clinical case flow                      |
| `ClinicalTurn`    | Encodes each narrative moment                            |
| `Echo`            | Stores consequences from prior turns                     |
| `SemanticAnchor`  | Tags each step with ontological grounding                |
| `MetaLayer`       | Governs interpretation, audit, and reproducibility logic |

### Simulation Flow

1. **Initialization**  
   Load case, assign semantic space, define simulation depth

2. **Turn Processing**  
   For each turn:
   - Read narrative
   - Apply semantic anchor
   - Detect and log echoes

3. **Feedback Application**  
   Echoes modify trust, timeline, or reasoning direction

4. **Termination**  
   Case ends at diagnostic closure, model halt, or outcome

5. **Export and Review**  
   All logs, anchors, and ECOs are exported for external validation

---

### Design Goals

- **Transparency**: Every action in the protocol must be explainable  
- **Auditability**: Steps are logged, anchored, and semantically versioned  
- **Interoperability**: Based on FHIR, ICD-10, SNOMED CT  
- **Modularity**: Every part is inspectable, reusable, and extensible
